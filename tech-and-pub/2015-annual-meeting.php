	University of Kentucky (UK) was a leader in the development of the rail system in the United States, having one of the first operative railroads in 1831.  Its rail system has had a major presence on the development and sustainability of the state’s coal industry since the very early 1900s.   Several of this nation’s major north-south heavy traffic rail lines -- CSX, NS, and CN – pass through Kentucky.  These comprise the bulk of Kentucky’s over 2,500 miles of track. This is augmented with local collector lines mainly operated by smaller rail companies.  <br><br>
	The Civil Engineering Department at the University of Kentucky was an early leader among universities in the re-establishment of an academic emphasis in railway transportation beginning in the early 1980s.  The Rail-Related Research Program is a major component of UK’s railway emphasis.  Numerous Research Projects have been conducted during the past thirty years.  These are funded by a combination of railroad companies, governmental agencies, and individuals.  Over fifty graduate and undergraduate students have participated in these studies.
